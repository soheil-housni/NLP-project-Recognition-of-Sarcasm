# NLP-project-Recognition-of-Sarcasm
The purpose of this project is to create a neural network able to recognize sarcasm in a setence.
In order to do that, I used TensorFlow and Keras, Tokenizer preprocessing and Padding
For this project, I used the dataset of Rishabh Misra "News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection" that I found on Kaggle.

This project is based on the video of "Training a model to recognize sentiment in text (NLP Zero to Hero - Part 3)" of the TensorFlow's "Natural Language Processing (NLP) Zero to Hero" formation.

You will find attached the code that I built
