# NLP-project-Detection-of-Sarcasm
The purpose of this project is to create a neural network able to recognize sarcasm in a setence.
In order to do that, I used TensorFlow and Keras, Tokenizer preprocessing and Padding
For this project, I used the dataset of Rishabh Misra "News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection" that I found on Kaggle.
Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection
This dataset contains 26709 articlesâ€™ headlines that are weather classified as sarcastic or not sarcastic.
This project is based on the video of "Training a model to recognize sentiment in text (NLP Zero to Hero - Part 3)" of the TensorFlow's "Natural Language Processing (NLP) Zero to Hero" formation. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_hzMnRXjhI&list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzDbLUZkbudP-MFQZwNmU4S&index=3
You will find attached the code that I built
